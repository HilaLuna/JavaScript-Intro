<h1> Fundamentals of JavaScript </h1>

In this repository, you'll find evidence of my exploration and experimentation as I navigated through the introductory landscapes of JavaScript. Each commit represents a step forward in my quest to understand the language that powers interactivity on the web. 

<h2> Technologies Used </h2>

<ul>

<li> HTML </li> </br>

<li> JavaScript </li> 

</ul>

<h2> Key Features </h2>

<ul>

<li> Starting with the simple step of writing 'Hello, World!', I've explored more complex interactions and continuing to explore the possibilities that JavaScript unlocks. </li> </br>

<li> Variables: Delved into the usage of 'var', 'let' and 'const' variables in JavaScript. </li> </br>

<li> Functions: A gentle introduction to the concept of functions in JavaScript, understanding their role, and why they are crucial in the language. Learn how to declare functions, use parameters, and return values with practical examples. </li> </br>

<li> Objects: Explored the fundamentals of creating and working with objects in JavaScript and how to define properties, methods, and handle object literals. </li> </br>

<li> Listeners: Had a little intro into a few listeners such as onchange, onclick, onmouseover, onmouseout, onkeydown etc. </li> </br>

<li> Literal Templates: With the help of literal templates, I explored cleaner and more readable multi-line strings without the need for concatenation. </li> </br>

</ul>
